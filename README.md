Snes9x - Portable Super Nintendo Entertainment System (TM) emulator

A frontend based on DirectFB for full screen display

- At this stage, only fixed buttons/controls are supported.
  - On computer keyboard: 
      L, R, W, E, S, D, SPACE, ENTER, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
      F1 to F9 = restore previous saved game
      shift + F1 to F9 = save game state
      R = reset
      ESC = exit
  - Default gamepad also works ok, on default buttons (I guess)
